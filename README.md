Authorization package with complex permission handling

## Why?

Sometimes managing permissions of an application can be difficult. This package aims to leverage the complexity of permissions by providing a simple interface to manage them.

You still have the control of which actions, resources and scopes are allowed, but now with a simple `app.use` you can lock everything behind authentication and check if the user has the required permissions on any controller, or using a permission-specific middleware on a route basis.
